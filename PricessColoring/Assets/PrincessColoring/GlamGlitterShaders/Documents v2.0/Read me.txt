Please don't redistribuite or share this package, thanks.

In this release there is not a camera in the scenes to avoid compatibility problems.
If you want you can add a First Person Controller, or similar, from Unity Standard Asset.

The manual is not ready yet, it will be available soon with a link in the official forum discussion at this link:

Although there is not a manual yet, the use of the shaders is simple and intuitive.
